        I am interested in anything computer-related.
        So far, I have had the chance to develop Android mobile applications,
        full-stack web applications and video game console emulators.
        Always excited to learn and gain new experiences in the ever-expanding world of Computer Science.

        Recently, I just concluded my internship at Amazon Lab126, where I had the rare
        opportunity to see and work on new upcoming Amazon products.

        Looking forward to any challenges!
