        Hello, I'm Minh.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a efficiency-oriented and result-driven Computer Science undergraduate.
        I'm always eager to learn and gain new experiences in the ever-expanding world of technology.
        So far, I have explored various areas,
        including <b>Android</b> mobile application development,
        full-stack <b>web</b> applications,
        and even video game console <b>emulators</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most recently, I completed an internship at <b>Amazon Lab126</b>,
        where I had the rare opportunity to work on exciting new Amazon products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking forward to any challenges!
