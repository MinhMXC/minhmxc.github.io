      <h1>Hey there ヾ(＾ ∇ ＾)</h1>
      <p>I am Minh, a <u>technology enthusiast</u> and a <u>problem solver</u>.</p>
      <p>
        I'm a penultimate-year Computer Science undergraduate at the
        National University of Singapore.

      <p>
        Computer has always been an interest of mine since I was young.
        I have been tinkering with computers since I was 12 and I started
        to learn programming when I was 14.
        Back then, I used Java to made a calculator with GUI using JavaFx.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love engaging with anything computer-related and am always excited to
        learn and gain new experiences in the ever-expanding world of Computer Science.
        So far, I have had the chance to develop Android mobile applications,
        full-stack web applications and video game console emulators.
      </p>

        Recently, I just concluded my internship at Amazon Lab126, where I had the rare
        opportunity to see and work on new upcoming Amazon products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking forward to any challenges!
